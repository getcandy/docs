# Welcome to GetCandy :tada:

GetCandy is an open source E-Commerce API, written in Laravel and supplied as a composer package. There are no templates to wrestle with, no caching to contend with and no obscure sessions to deal with. Just a straight up RESTful API you can consume with anything that can make HTTP Requests.

The idea was born out of the frustration of a lack of E-Commerce providers that didn't make drastic and opinionated workflows into how you should build your online store, we felt this should be left to who know's best...you!

Since the API is a Laravel package, you just install it via composer into your new or existing app and you're all set. The goal is to provide an E-Commerce solution that you truly can customise and tailor to your exact needs.
