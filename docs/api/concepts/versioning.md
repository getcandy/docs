# Versioning

::: warning ISSUE For Alec
Wasn't sure how to rollback? Not sure how much detail to go into here, or save it for the products section etc.

Resources in GetCandy can be versioned. For example, when editing a product the API will generate a draft version for you to make your edits on. When you are happy with your edits you can publish the draft and your changes will go live. At the same time the system will make a copy of the previous version and store it in the database. This creates a version history so you can see when updates to a resource were made and even rollback to a previous version.

Using the admin hub will demonstrate this functionality well.
