# Recyle Bin

This concept is going to be quite familiar. When deleting resources (such as products) you are actually soft-deleting the database entry. Sometimes you may wish to see what's been deleted and also restore entries. The recycle bin allows you to do just that. You can list out the entries via the API and also restore them.

If you really want to, you can also "hard delete" and entry in the recyle bin - this will permanently delete it forever!

Not much else to say. Check the API reference and also the implementation in the admin hub.
